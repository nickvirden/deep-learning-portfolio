# Deep Learning Portfolio

This portfolio contains all of the supervised and unsupervised Machine Learning and Deep Learning topics that I've covered.

This README will give brief notes on my understanding of the topic discussed in each section and direct links to each of the Python files that contain both code and inline notes.
